# Introduction to Solr

Solr is optimized to handle data exhibiting these characteristics:

- text-centric
- read-dominant
- document-oriented
- flexible schema

Notes:

- Documents in Solr must be flat. Fields can have multiple values, but they
  canâ€™t be nested.

- **Information retrieval** (IR) is finding material (usually documents) of an
unstructured nature that satisfies an information need from within large
collections.

- Ranking documents by relevance is a key aspect of information retrieval.

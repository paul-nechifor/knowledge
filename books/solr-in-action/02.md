# Getting to know Solr

- The Solr home dir encapsulates one or more cores.

- Cores were specified in `solr.xml`, but can be autodiscovered now.

Query parameters:

- `q`: documents are scored by their similarity to terms in this parameter

- `fg` (filter query): restricts results but doesn’t affect scoring

- `sort`

- `start` (zero based)

- `rows`: number of results to return

- `fl`: list of fields to return

- `df` (default field): field that’s searched for terms that don’t specify a
  field

You should only return a few results since Lucene is optimized for query
processing (maximizing matching and scoring documents).

To clean up your index you can delete the contents of
`solr/collection-name/data/*`.

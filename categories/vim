===
Use `n` flag:

    :%s/\<str\>//gn

===
Use the `c` (confirm) flag:

    :%s/cat/kitty/gc

How can you find the number of times the word `'cat'` appears in a file? Don't
count partial matches of a word (i.e. catastrophic shouldn't match).

###
You have files `alpha` and `beta` in your current directory. Using a single Bash
command open them in two tabs (in that order).
===

    vim -p alpha beta

###
Running `vim -p alpha beta` would open those files in two tabs, with `alpha`
being the current one. Modify the command so that it focuses on the last tab on
line 10.
===
    vim -p alpha beta +"tablast | 10"
